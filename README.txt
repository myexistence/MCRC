A simple and crude minecraft calculator
I made this because GTNH doesn't have a calculator I like
Key features:
    *Keeps track of recipe depth and prints parent recipe
    *Consolidates precursors that exist in multiple recipes
    *Sorts output of recipes by amount
More features coming as I learn more, maybe a gui would be cool
